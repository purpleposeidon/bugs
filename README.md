# Assumptions Where Bugs Hide
### The input data is correct.
### The following behavior is correct.
### The component is correct.
### You are reading all of the code.
### The program you are debugging is the one you are editing.
### You are actually changing the input.
### There is exactly 1 input.
### There is no input.
### Your debugger is debugging with the input that you think it is.
### All expected inputs are being received.
### The function name is not lies.
### The function documentation is not lies.
### The library function is not broken.
### "xyz" is not "xyy" is not "xzy" is not "xxx" is not "zyx".
### The output is going somewhere.
### The object is constant.
### The object is mutable. (eg, you're not doing `thing.add(whatever)` & ignoring the result.)
### The repository is in an atomic state. (There are no uncommited changes interfering with expectations.)
